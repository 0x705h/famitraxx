Building NES ROMs on Debian based Systems
-----------------------------------------

You must download the cc65 compiler from 
http://debian.trikaliotis.net/cc65/

For example:
```
$ wget http://debian.trikaliotis.net/cc65/cc65_2.13.9-svn5804-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i cc65_2.13.9-svn5804-1_amd64.deb

```
And you're done. Now you can compile this code in your Debian based system.
